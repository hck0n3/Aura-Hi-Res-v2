    // and the UI hammers these setters at slider-drag rate, so the window is hit often.

    // filter's parameters (new frequency against an old type, say) is an audible CLICK. That is what
    // the old mutex bought, and it may not be given up.
    //
    // Both are satisfied by a three-slot single-producer/single-consumer buffer:
    //
    //  * The three slot indices {0,1,2} are permanently partitioned between `writerSlot` (owned by
    //    writers), the index parked inside `readySlot`, and `audioSlot` (owned by the audio thread).
    //    Both handovers are a SINGLE atomic exchange, so an index can never be duplicated or lost.
    //    A writer therefore can never write the slot the audio thread is reading, and vice versa —
    //    with no lock between them and no possibility of the reader waiting.
    //
    //  * A writer fills its private slot with a COMPLETE set, then release-exchanges its index into
    //    `readySlot`. The audio thread acquire-loads `readySlot` and, only if the dirty bit is set,
    //    acquire-exchanges its own index in. That acquire synchronizes-with the writer's release, so
    //    every store into the slot happens-before the audio thread's reads of it. The audio thread
    //    sees the whole new set or the whole previous one — never a mixture.
    //
    // The release/acquire pairing is load-bearing, not decoration. Every shipped ABI is ARM
    // (armeabi-v7a / arm64-v8a), which is WEAKLY ORDERED: with a plain field, a `volatile`, or a
    // RELAXED atomic, both the compiler and the CPU are free to make the flag store visible before
    // the coefficient stores that precede it, and the audio thread would then apply a mixture of the
    // two sets — exactly the click this design exists to prevent.
    //
    // Cost on the audio thread: one acquire load per block, plus one exchange only on blocks where
