/**
 * GENRE-AWARE CONTINUATION — the profile of a FINISHED finite context (playlist / album / EP / single,
 * uniformly), built from the WHOLE pool the user started from so the infinite radio can keep steering
 * toward what that collection actually was (its artists + its real genre mix) instead of drifting off
 * with whatever YouTube relates to the last song. Owner case: a salsa playlist whose continuation
 * wandered into generic Latin/pop.
 *
 * Pure and unit-testable (no Android, no network, no player): the caller passes the pool and ONE
 * [GenreCache] snapshot; genre inference and normalization are delegated to [GenreLane.laneOfTrack] so
 * the profile's genre ids agree with the lane-keeping path (same lane vocabulary, same primary-artist
 * splitting, same Christian collapse).
 *
 * FAIL-NEUTRAL BY DESIGN (registry #39/#41 — a cache-derived signal inherits the cache's bias):
 *  - [Profile.active] gates EVERY consumer: below minimum signal (coverage and known artists both low)
 *    the profile must be treated as absent and behavior stays byte-identical to today.
 *  - [steerTerm] is a BOUNDED additive score nudge ([STEER_MIN]..[STEER_MAX]) for [MusicService]'s
 *    orderedByTaste key — NEVER a filter, NEVER a drop.
 *  - A candidate whose genre is UNKNOWN carries [UNKNOWN_GENRE_PUSH] (+1, ONE rank on an index-dominated
 *    key) — see that constant for why "exactly 0.0" was the hole behind the owner's intermittent
 *    genre mixing, and why +1 cannot collapse the queue onto the library.

     * The nudge for a candidate whose genre is UNKNOWN, while a genre-bearing profile is steering.

     * It used to be exactly 0.0, and that WAS the owner's "la cola inteligente me mezcla géneros":
     * an unknown candidate scored 0.0 while an on-genre one earned up to [STEER_MIN] (-4), so a
     * wrong-genre song at relatedness rank 2 outranked a right-genre song at rank 8. Because the cache
     * fills in batches (WiFi-gated, capped) the SAME artist is unknown on one append and known on the
     * next — which is exactly why he heard it as right / wrong / right / wrong instead of consistently
     * wrong.
     *
     * ONE, deliberately: the sort key is `index - pull + soft + jitter + ctx`, where `index` is the
     * relatedness rank and steps by exactly 1.0 per rank. +1 therefore moves an unknown candidate back
     * by ONE rank — enough to lose a tie to a known on-genre candidate at the same rank, and nothing
     * more. Registry #39/#41 still holds by construction:
     *  - it is a NUDGE on a positional key, never a filter and never a drop — an unknown candidate is
     *    still eligible, still played, and a batch made entirely of unknowns comes out in YouTube's
     *    own relatedness order (every item shifted by the same +1);
     *  - it is 6x smaller than [OFF_GENRE_PUSH], so "we don't know" is never treated as "wrong genre";
     *  - a candidate by a CONTEXT ARTIST is matched cache-free and takes [ARTIST_PULL] instead, so the
     *    push can never fire on the collection's own artists;
     *  - it only applies when the profile actually knows some genres ([Profile.genreShare] non-empty)
     *    and passed [Profile.active] — a cache that knows nothing steers nothing;
     *  - and it buys NO exclusion anywhere: see [blocksExploration], which is deliberately gated on a
     *    KNOWN genre so this push can never become a filter by the back door.

     * automatic continuation, and each batch head was left to the taste pull, i.e. to artists the
