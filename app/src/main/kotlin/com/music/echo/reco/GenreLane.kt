/**
 * "Style lane" inference so autoplay can keep the same line as what you're listening to (Christian stays
 * Christian, Latin stays Latin, Rock stays Rock — instead of drifting). Two signals, in order:
 *
 *  1. [laneOf] — a keyword classifier over a track's title + artist + album text. It only makes a POSITIVE
 *     call for lanes with unambiguous markers (currently "christian"); it exists because YouTube doesn't tag
 *     lyrical content and it also catches Christian tracks whose artist isn't in the genre cache yet.
 *  2. [laneOfTrack] — the artist's REAL primary genre from [GenreCache] (iTunes: "Latin", "Rock",
 *     "Hip-Hop/Rap", "Pop"...), normalized to a lane id. This is what makes the lane follow the actual genre
 *     being played rather than a single hardcoded style.
 *
 * Anything we can't call is UNKNOWN (null) — the caller then enforces nothing, and even with a known lane it
 * only enforces when it has enough same-lane candidates, so playback never dead-ends. Combined with
 * "No me gusta", the more you correct it the cleaner it stays.
