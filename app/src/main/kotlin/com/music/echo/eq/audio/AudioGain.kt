 * Loudness makeup gain (dB, >= 0) that brings a quiet track UP toward the reference loudness so it

 * is the stream's loudness relative to reference (YouTube convention: normalize by `-loudnessDb`). Only
 * the positive (boost) part is returned here — attenuation of loud masters is handled separately by
 * [normalizationMultiplier]. Capped at [maxBoostDb] so a very quiet track isn't boosted so hard that it
 * over-drives the downstream true-peak limiter — too much makeup makes the limiter reduce gain heavily,
 * which sounds like harmonic saturation / a harsh, "boxy" voice, especially at max volume.
 *
 * Capped at [maxBoostDb] = **+12 dB**.
 *
 * +12 was validated in the v0.0.9 setup against `TruePeakLimiterAudioProcessor`, whose `softLimit` is a
 * STATIC tanh knee — it saturates but has no time constant, so it physically cannot pump. That processor
 * is now a dead stub, and the makeup is applied ahead of Superpowered's Limiter instead, which is a
 * GAIN-RIDING limiter (threshold -3 dB, ceiling -1 dBFS, release 0.1 s). Feeding +12 dB into that on a
 * dynamic master (YouTube loudnessDb ~ -9, i.e. quiet-but-peaky classical / jazz / hi-res — exactly the
 * material this player exists for) demands 9-12 dB of gain reduction on every transient, with the
 * envelope recovering between them: audible pumping, plus flattened macro-dynamics. Loud masters are
 * unaffected (they get attenuation, makeup = 0), so the artifact would appear ONLY on the best recordings.
 *
 * At +3 dB a -1 dBFS master needs ~3 dB of reduction on its rarest peaks only. Raising this safely needs
 * PEAK data (`makeupDb = min(cap, -1 - truePeakDbFS)`), which requires a peak column on FormatEntity and a
 * measurement pass — until that exists, we restore +12 dB to fix tracks sounding quieter than others.
