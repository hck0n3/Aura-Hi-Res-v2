     * Gain pair (incoming, outgoing) for crossfade progress [p] in 0..1, per the selected style.
     *  0 = Linear: straight amplitude ramp (1 - p); amplitude sum never exceeds 1.0.
     *  1 = Smooth/equal-power (default): sin/cos keep incoming^2 + outgoing^2 = 1 (constant power), so
     *      both tracks carry the SAME power through the blend — the natural, even crossfade.
     *  2 = Long S-curve: equal-power but eased timing (very gradual in/out).
     *  3 = Exponential (quick): each track dominates its half, snappier handover.
     *  4 = Asymmetric rise (owner-tuned): BOTH directions are gradual — the outgoing decays over the
     *      WHOLE window on a smoothstep-eased equal-power cosine (gentle start, gentle landing), and the
     *      incoming rises over the first ~85% on a smoothstep-eased sine, so it is audibly "making
     *      itself noticed" for most of the blend and arrives at full level with ZERO slope (no audible
     *      "kink"). The asymmetry keeps the radio-segue "natural rise in intensity" feel. Never the
     *      default; selectable only.
     *  5 = V-fade (sequential, Poweramp-style "fade out, then in"): the outgoing fades fully OUT over
     *      the first half, then the incoming fades fully IN over the second half — the two songs are
     *      NEVER audible at once, so key/tempo clashes are impossible by design. The handover is
     *      back-to-back (a=b=0.5): the instant the outgoing dies the incoming is born — no silence
     *      gap, so the never-silence invariant holds (the research's configurable-gap variant was
     *      deliberately dropped for that reason).
     *  6 = Logarithmic / dB-linear (R=60dB, ffmpeg "log" / audio taper): a straight line on the dB
     *      scale — the decay the ear perceives as EVEN (the classic mastering/radio fade). Each track
     *      sits near −30dB at the midpoint, so the songs barely overlap audibly: the old one "dies
     *      for real" and the new one is born. The −60dB floor is spliced out exactly (subtract and
     *      renormalize) so the endpoints land at exactly 0 and 1.
     *  7 = Deep dip (CUBIC dipped): both gains are cubes, so the summed amplitude dips to 0.25 (−12dB)
     *      at the center — a clearly-audible "breath" between songs without ever reaching silence.
     *      Deliberately CUBIC, not parabolic: the parabolic dipped family is byte-identical to curve 3
     *      (Exponencial), so this deeper variant is what earns its own slot in the A/B set — the middle
     *      ground between curve 3's gentle −6dB dip and the V-fade's full valley.
     *  8 = Equal-GAIN raised cosine ("hsin", Hann window): sin²/cos² — amplitudes sum to EXACTLY 1 at
     *      every point, with zero-slope ends (the gentlest possible start and landing). The only pair
     *      that can never bump on correlated material (same-take edits, versions/remixes); on
     *      uncorrelated songs it has a soft −3dB power valley mid-blend. The equal-gain sibling of
     *      curve 2's equal-power S — the most educational A/B in the set.
