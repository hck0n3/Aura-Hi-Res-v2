//    If a screen has no new implementation yet it renders the classic one, flag or not.
//  · TOGGLING IS INERT. Flipping this key must not touch the database, playback, the queue, or any other
//    preference. Turning it OFF returns the app to byte-identical classic behaviour.
// Launch default is ON (fresh installs / unset key). Existing explicit `false` is never overwritten.
