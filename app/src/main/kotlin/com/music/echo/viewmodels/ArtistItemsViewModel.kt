 * The "multi-track only" rule is the whole point. [iTunesDiscography.normalizeTitle] strips the "- Single"
 * suffix, so iTunes' 1-track "Look Up Child - Single" lands on the SAME key as the 13-track album
 * "Look Up Child". A plain MIN therefore pinned the floor at 1, which collapsed the gate
 * (`songCount < ceil(1 * 0.6)` only rejects an album with ZERO songs): a 3-of-13 truncated upload passed
 * [isComplete], counted as already-present, was never re-completed, and outranked a complete community
 * upload during reconciliation. Only editions with more than one track may set the floor.
 *
 * A title iTunes knows ONLY as a 1-track release really is a single, so it keeps its own count as the floor.
 * Unknown counts (0) never become the floor; a title with nothing but unknowns maps to 0 = "do not gate".
 *
 * "More than one track" is NOT enough on its own, because the same suffix strip also collapses "- EP":
 * a 4-track "X - EP" shares the key of the 12-track album "X" and pins the floor at 4, whose gate is
 * `ceil(4 * 0.6) = 3` — so a 3-of-12 TRUNCATED upload passes [isComplete], is marked present by
 * [countsAsHave] and can win Phase D, replacing the real album. The MAX-based rule this replaced demanded 8.
 *
 * Hence the ratio rule: an edition with LESS THAN HALF the tracks of the fullest known edition is a
 * mini/EP/sampler pressing, not a legitimate short edition of the album, and may not set the gate. Half is
 * chosen because it separates the two cases cleanly in real catalogs — a standard edition is never under
 * half of its own deluxe (12 vs 24, 13 vs 24: kept, so the MIN-across-stores rule that protects standard
 * editions survives), while an EP/mini is (4 vs 12, 2 vs 12: ignored). A genuinely short album still keeps a
 * real floor: it is the fullest edition of itself, so it always passes its own ratio test.
 *
 * The remaining error is deliberately one-sided. A floor that is too HIGH only wastes one search — the
 * release stays in `missing`, is looked up again, and Phase D still falls back to the best album it has. A
 * floor that is too LOW admits a truncated upload as the winner, which is a visibly broken album.

     * SELF-HEALING of [completedCache]: re-run the completion ONCE, in the background, for an artist section

     * Why it exists: a degraded run used to be cached exactly as incomplete as the network made it, and every
     * later open republished it verbatim — no network, no retry, no way to refresh. The discography stayed
     * short for the whole process lifetime ("la discografía SIGUE sin salir completa").
     *
     * What it is NOT: it is not a poller and it does not loop. It is scheduled only by a real user action
     * (opening the section again), never on the FIRST open of an artist, and only when ALL of these hold:
     *  • the cached entry is degraded (a clean entry is never re-run: nothing to heal),
     *  • it was built at least [DEGRADED_REPAIR_MIN_AGE_MS] ago (so the repair does not ride the same bad
     *    connection that produced it), and
     *  • no repair has been started for this section yet in this process ([repairAttempted]).
     *
     * WORST-CASE COST — one repair equals at most ONE more completion run, i.e. the same bound as the first
     * open: ≤7 iTunes store requests + ≤60 base quality probes + ≤80 releases × ≤4 requests each (album
     * search, playlist search, playlist songs, album fetch) + ≤80 found-album probes ≈ 470 requests, at 6
     * concurrent (the existing semaphore). In practice far fewer: albumQualityCache / fullAlbumCache are
     * process-wide, so everything the first run already resolved is served from memory. And it can happen AT
     * MOST ONCE per artist section for the entire life of the process — a permanently bad network costs one
     * extra run, not one per open.

     * A community playlist matched a missing release, but the playlist is only a DISCOVERY vehicle: its own

     * album via [YouTube.album] and return it, so the discography shows the full release instead of the

     * IT IS AN ACCEPTANCE DECISION, NOT A LOOKUP. Whatever it returns is published by Phase D essentially
     * unchallenged: for a completion-only group there is no competing base album and no community playlist
     * left (this branch consumed it), so Phase D's last-resort `bestAlbum` line emits it even when it fails
     * the gate. Every rule the album-search branch applies must therefore be applied HERE:
     *
     *  • CREDIT — [credited], so a same-titled record by another artist is not adopted.
     *  • TITLE RELATION — [titleMatch] against [target]. Without it the "album most tracks belong to" wins by
     *    majority alone, so a playlist padded with an unrelated compilation ("Colección de Oro") publishes
     *    that compilation as the missing release.
     *  • LIVENESS — [matchesLiveness] against [requestedKey]. A request for "X (En Vivo)" whose tracks point
     *    at the STUDIO album must be REJECTED, not answered with the studio record: the live edition would
     *    stay missing while its slot was spent, which is the exact bug the album branch already fixed.
     *  • INSTRUMENTAL — a karaoke/backing-track upload is not the release (unless iTunes says this release is
     *    genuinely instrumental, [allowInstrumental]).
     *  • COMPLETENESS — the FULL track list must clear [isComplete] against [floor]. A community playlist that
     *    references a 3-track upload of a 13-track album must add NOTHING, exactly as before this feature
     *    existed; and a zero-track album (YouTube.albumSongs ends in `?: emptyList()`, so a parse miss is a
     *    SUCCESS with no songs) is rejected outright.
     *
     * Bounded and deduped: exactly ONE album is chosen and fetched ONCE — the outcome is cached by albumId in
     * [fullAlbumCache], so several releases resolving to the same album, and several tracks of the same album,
     * never trigger more than one fetch. The cache stores the FETCH, not an approval: the rules above are
     * re-applied on every hit, because the same album can be right for one requested release and wrong for
     * another. The fetch also seeds [albumQualityCache] (conclusive results only, see [cacheAlbumQuality])
     * from the FULL track list, so Phase C/D judge the whole album rather than the playlist's partial count
     * and never re-probe it.
     *
     * Returns null whenever the tracks carry no usable album id, the fetch fails, or any rule above rejects
     * the album — the caller then falls back to the partial playlist (itself floor-gated) rather than
     * dropping the release, and the reason is logged.
