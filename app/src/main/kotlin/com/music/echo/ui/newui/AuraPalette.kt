/**
 * The "Interfaz nueva" palette, transcribed 1:1 from the reference render
 * (`8-DISENO-REAL-con-iconos.html`, `:root` custom properties).
 *
 * Three accents and one ground. NOTHING else is a brand colour: the gradient play button is the only
 * full-colour element on a screen, everything else is white at a low alpha over [Ground].
 *
 * Screen agents: never hard-code a hex. Use these values or the derived helpers below, so a palette
 * tweak lands everywhere at once.
 *
 * ## THE THREE ACCENTS AND THE GROUND ARE NO LONGER CONSTANTS (0.6.147)
 * They were, and that was the owner's original complaint coming back through the side door: he picks
 * one of the 46 swatches (or types a hex, or leaves the dynamic artwork/wallpaper accent on), the ~89
 * classic screens and every dialog repaint, and the redesign stayed a fixed teal because ~143 call
 * sites read `AuraPalette.Teal` / `.Blue` / `.Violet` from this object. The same shape of bug hid
 * AMOLED: `PureBlackKey` moved `colorScheme.surface` to black while the new screens kept painting
 * [Ground] (`#060A12`), so dragging the queue up went pure black and dragging it back down brought the
 * blue-black ground back, in one gesture.
 *
 * Both are fixed HERE, in one file, rather than at 143 call sites:
 *  · [Teal] / [Blue] / [Violet] and everything derived from them read [accent], a snapshot-backed value.
 *  · [Ground] / [GroundRaised] read [pureBlackGround], likewise.
 *  · [AuraPaletteSync] resolves both ONCE per theme change and writes them. It is called from
 *    [NewUiGate] (so every gated surface has them before it composes) and from the shell
 *    (`AuraNavigationBar`, `AuraMiniPlayer`), which `MainActivity` composes outside any gate.
 *
 * Because the reads happen inside composition and inside draw lambdas, a theme change repaints every
 * new surface with no per-frame work and no call-site edits. **With the flag off [AuraPaletteSync]
 * never runs, nothing is ever written, and every value below is the literal that shipped** — which is
 * what makes this reversible term for term.

     * The render's `rgba(255,255,255,.07)` is 7 % white over the page body, and in the render nothing
     * is ever stacked under it. On Android two situations break that assumption and both have now been
     * reported by the owner as the same symptom — "está tan transparente que no se define nada":
     *  · the mini-player pill, because `BottomSheet` does not compose its ground slot while collapsed,
     *    so the 7 % landed straight on the NavHost (fixed in `AuraMiniPlayer` with an opaque base);
     *  · Biblioteca's three floating actions, which DO have `auraScreenBackground` under them but are
     *    drawn ABOVE the scrolling list, so what is actually behind the glass is a grid of album
     *    covers. 7 % white over a bright cover is not a surface at all: the cover reads through the
     *    label.
     *
     * ## Why it is opaque and not a blur
     * The owner asked for the buttons to be "borrosos" so their content can be read. A live backdrop
     * blur is precisely what the thermal contract forbids (it samples and blurs the frame under the
     * control on every frame, for as long as the control is on screen). Compositing the render's own
     * film onto an opaque base costs nothing, and it is *more* legible than a blur, not less: the
     * label lands at ~14.8:1 over this plate (`#EAF2FF` on `#191E28`) — a blurred bright cover would
     * still leave a light backdrop under light text.
     *
     * The base is [GroundRaised] rather than [Ground] so a floating control reads one step ABOVE the
     * screen it floats over instead of punching a hole in it, which is the same base
     * `AuraMiniPlayer` already stands on.
     *
     * Wherever a `SurfaceFill` control DOES have the ground directly behind it (every card, chip, sort
     * pill and search field inside a list) keep using [SurfaceFill]: on the ground the two are within
     * one step of each other and the film is the render's.
     *
     * A `Color` is an inline value class, so this getter allocates nothing on the heap.

         * near-white, i.e. Marfil `#F2EDE3`, which passes on the first test anyway — it falls back to

/**
 * Resolves the redesign's accent, ground and cover radius from the user's Apariencia settings and
 * publishes them to [AuraPalette].
 *
 * ## Once per theme change, never per composable and never per frame
 * The only work is one `remember` keyed on (the accent the app is wearing, the ground, the
 * "has the user chosen anything?" verdict) — so the HSV walk in [AuraAccent.from] runs on a theme
 * change and on nothing else. [AuraPalette.apply] then writes global snapshot state, so all ~143 call
 * sites see one resolution rather than each doing its own. The write is idempotent, so composing this
 * from several places at once (the gate, the nav bar, the mini player) costs a comparison.
 *
 * ## Where the accent comes from
 * [MaterialTheme.colorScheme] `primary` — i.e. whatever the app's own theme engine produced, so the
 * swatch, the typed hex, "Intensidad del color", the named preset and the dynamic artwork/wallpaper
 * accent all arrive already resolved. There is deliberately no second copy of that engine here; a
 * second copy is how the two halves of the app drifted apart in the first place.
 *
 * ## When it does NOT follow
 * When the user has chosen nothing at all — the stored accent is still the sentinel, no preset is
 * active and the dynamic theme is off — the app's own scheme is generated from [DefaultThemeColor], a
 * red the user never asked for. In that one state the redesign keeps its shipped teal/blue/violet,
 * which is what "keep the fixed values as the fallback" means. In every other state it follows, so the
 * six new screens and the ~89 classic ones are the same colour.
