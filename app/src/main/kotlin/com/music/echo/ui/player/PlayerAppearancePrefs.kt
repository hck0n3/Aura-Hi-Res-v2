/**
 * # Player appearance preferences that EVERY player shape must obey
 *
 * The classic player used to be the only read site of four Ajustes ▸ Apariencia controls, while the
 * "Interfaz nueva" player drew its own transport, its own fullscreen lyrics and its own menu. The rows
 * stayed visible with the new UI on — so the user could pick a button style, hide the status bar or
 * hide the volume control and nothing happened. That is the placebo pattern the owner had 1717 lines
 * deleted to erradicate.
 *
 * Everything below is the ONE implementation of those preferences. Both players call into this file;
 * neither re-derives a colour, re-writes an insets effect or re-invents the gesture. If a fifth player
 * shape ever appears, it honours the four settings by calling these — and cannot honour them halfway.
 *
 * One Ajustes ▸ **Reproductor** control now lives here too — "Mantener la pantalla encendida cuando el
 * reproductor está expandido" ([KeepScreenOnWhilePlayerExpandedEffect]). It is not an appearance
 * setting, but it is the same shape of problem: a window-level effect that every player shape must run
 * and that had exactly one read site, so with the new UI on it only worked after rotating the phone.
 * The file's rule is "one implementation per player-wide preference", and that is why it is here.

/**
 * Holds `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON` while the player sheet is EXPANDED and playback is actually running.
 *
 * The row is in Ajustes ▸ Reproductor (`R.string.keep_screen_on_when_player_is_expanded`) and is
 * reachable with either UI, but its only consumer used to be [BottomSheetPlayer]. With "Interfaz
 * nueva" on, PORTRAIT is `AuraPortraitPlayer` and landscape / wide falls through to the classic sheet
 * (AuraPlayer.kt), so the switch did nothing until the phone was rotated — a control that appears to
 * work and does not, which the owner rates worse than one that never works.
 *
 * ## This is THE implementation — extracted, not rewritten
 * The lines below were lifted out of the classic player's status-bar `DisposableEffect`, where the two
 * unrelated concerns shared one block. What the old block did, exactly:
 *  · body, guarded by `window != null && state.isExpanded`:
 *    `if (keepScreenOn && state.isExpanded) addFlags else clearFlags`, with
 *    `keepScreenOn = isPlaying && pref`;
 *  · `onDispose`: `clearFlags`, unconditionally.
 *
 * So while COLLAPSED the body ran nothing — but `state.isExpanded` was an effect KEY, so collapsing
 * disposed the previous instance first and that `onDispose` had already cleared the flag. Net: the flag
 * was held exactly while `isExpanded && isPlaying && pref`, and cleared in every other state. [hold]
 * below is that same predicate, stated once instead of split across a guard, a condition and a dispose.
 *
 * ## Why [currentMediaId] is a key
 * NOT decoration, and not "in case": the shared [iad1tya.echo.music.ui.component.Lyrics] composable
 * `addFlags` the SAME window flag while lyrics are open and `clearFlags` it on dispose. Closing the
 * lyrics therefore drops a flag this effect is still meant to be holding. The old effect happened to
 * re-key on `mediaMetadata?.id`, so the next track change re-asserted it; keeping that key preserves
 * that self-healing verbatim, and now gives it to the new player too. (Both players pass their own
 * `mediaMetadata?.id`, which is the very value the classic effect used.)
 *
 * The old effect also re-keyed on `playerBackground` and `useDarkTheme` — the insets half's inputs,
 * which this half never read. Dropping them changes no state this effect puts the window in; it only
 * removes a redundant clear-and-re-add on a theme change. Stated plainly rather than claimed as
 * equivalence: the sole sequence in which they differ is "something external cleared the flag, and the
 * user then changed theme/background without changing track", where the old code re-asserted a frame
 * earlier than the new one does.
 *
 * ## Thermal / battery
 * Nothing per frame. The flag is released on EVERY exit: the predicate going false, the sheet
 * collapsing, the player leaving composition. `onDispose` clears unconditionally rather than re-testing
 * the predicate, because a leaked KEEP_SCREEN_ON is an invisible battery drain and the cost of clearing
 * a flag that was never set is zero.
 *
 * @param isExpanded the sheet's own expanded state — a collapsed (mini) player never holds the flag.
 * @param isPlaying the LOCAL player's playing state, so a paused player lets the screen sleep.
 * @param currentMediaId the playing track's id; see "Why [currentMediaId] is a key" above.
